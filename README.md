## About

Around is an **endless runner** game where the main goal is to survive as long as you can (achieve the **highest score**). The player is controlling the spaceship **orbiting** the **procedurally generated** planet. An entirely new planet is generated for each level (one full loop around a planet), as are the surrounding asteroids. The player has to **change** its orbit to **avoid** asteroids. Crushing into an asteroid will end the game. Passing by will increase the score, which is multiplied by the current level. The player has a special **shooting ability** available once per level to **destroy** those asteroids in emergencies.
